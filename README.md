üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nepali-share-market-hub.git
cd your-repository-name

2. Install Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
3. Configure API Keys

The application requires an API key for the Groq LLM service.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note: The provided llm_client.py hardcodes the API key. This is a major security risk and is not recommended for production or public repositories. The correct way is to use environment variables.

Recommended Setup:

Create a file named .env in the project's root directory.

Add your API key to this file:

GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_YourSecretGroqApiKeyGoesHere"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Modify llm_client.py to securely load the key:

# llm_client.py (Recommended Change)
import os
from groq import Groq
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv() # Loads variables from .env file

# Securely get the API key
groq_api_key = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")

if not groq_api_key:
    raise ValueError("GROQ_API_KEY not found in .env file. Please set it.")

groq_client = Groq(api_key=groq_api_key)

# ... rest
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You will also need to run pip install python-dotenv.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and the API key is configured, run the following command from your terminal:

streamlit run app.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Your web browser will automatically open with the application running.
